# Basic Unix Commands to use in Git Bash:

1- Current working directory
Checking the working directory using the command 'pwd'.

2- Navigating directory: using 'cd' command.

3- Making Directory: using 'mkdir' command.

4- List files and directories: using 'ls' command.

5- Making multiple folders at once:
 mkdir day-1 day-2 day-3.

6- To show detailed list of directories: use ls -la.

7- Creating file

We can use the touch command to write a file: touch day-1.txt


8- Opening and writing on file

9- Opening file to read:

We can use the cat command just only to read the file: cat day-1.txt

10- Rename file:

The mv command is used both to change the name of a file and to move a file into a different directory.


To rename a file: mv day-two.txt day-2.txt


11- Moving file and directory
The mv and cp commands can be used to put files into a directory. The cp moves the copy of the file or the folder to another folder, however, mv just move it without copying.


To move a file => cut: mv day-2.txt day-two # move day-2 text file to day-two folder

To copy a file: cp day-2.txt day-two # copy day-2 text file to day-two folder

12- Delete file and directory
Use 'rm' command to delete a file: rm day-2.txt

Use 'rmdir' command to delete whole folder: rmdir day-two
